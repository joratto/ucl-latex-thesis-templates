abstract = {Abstract We investigate the onset of magnetic reconnection, utilizing a fully kinetic Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation. Characteristic features of the electron phase-space distributions immediately before reconnection onset are identified. These include signatures of pressure non-gyrotropy in the velocity distributions, and lemon shaped distributions in the in-plane velocity directions. Further, we explain how these features form through particle energization by the out-of-plane electric field. Identification of these features in the distributions can aid in analysis of data where clear signatures of ongoing reconnection are not yet present.},

abstract = {Particle-in-cell simulations show that numerous ion-scale magnetic islands can be formed in a turbulent magnetic reconnection region. These islands can confine and accelerate electrons to high energies effectively, causing the energetic electron energy flux to peak at the center of each island. ARTEMIS spacecraft observations of turbulent reconnection outflows in Earth’s magnetotail reveal that peaks in the energetic electron energy flux are well correlated with bipolar signatures of reconnected magnetic field, which are indicative of ion-scale magnetic islands, providing observational evidence for this acceleration process.}

title = {Turbulence and Particle Acceleration in Collisionless Magnetic Reconnection: Effects of Temperature Inhomogeneity across Pre-reconnection Current Sheet},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Magnetic reconnection is an important process in various collisionless plasma environments because it reconfigures the magnetic field and releases magnetic energy to accelerate charged particles. Its dynamics depend critically on the properties of the pre-reconnection current sheet. One property in particular, cross-sheet temperature inhomogeneity, which is ubiquitous throughout the heliosphere, has been shown to increase reconnection outflow speed, energy conversion efficiency, and secondary island formation rate using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Here we expand upon these findings, considering two cases with a long, thin current sheet, one with homogeneous temperature and one with inhomogeneous temperature across the current sheet. In the inhomogeneous temperature case, numerous secondary islands form continuously, which increases current sheet turbulence (well-developed cascade power spectra) at large wavenumbers. Current density, energy conversion, dissipation, and acceleration of high-energy particles are also enhanced relative to the homogenous temperature case. Our results suggest that inhomogeneous temperature profiles, which are realistic, need to be incorporated into studies of turbulence and particle acceleration in collisionless magnetic reconnection.}

abstract = {This paper deals with the performance of the cross‐correlation function (CCF) for the case of time series which contain only a limited number of data. Often, in this case the data span a time interval shorter than the characteristic timescale of the underlying signal. Although various papers recently have been dedicated to this subject, most authors limit their approach to numerical simulations only, resulting in a lack of generality and no explanation of the difficulties associated with the use of the CCF in many practical situations. We show here, on the basis of theoretical considerations, that the limits of the CCF can be understood from the fact that in the construction of this function the low‐frequency components of the signals contribute more than the high‐frequency components. This result explains also the robustness of the CCF to the broadband noise.}

abstract = {This paper presents an application of the Hilbert Transform (HT) in the time delay estimation (TDE) of random signals by cross-correlation function (CCF). The use of HT in the cross-correlation analysis provided a CCFHT function that reaches zero value for transportation time delay τ0. This allowed replacing the traditional τ0 designation by looking for a position of the CCF main maximum with the zero crossing location of the CCFHT, which is easier to determine. A novelty in this paper is the analysis of metrological properties of the CCFHT method for three models of stochastic measuring signals with a random noise disturbance. For these models the standard uncertainties of the TDE using CCFHT and CCF for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the interval 0.01 ≤ SNR ≤ 100 have been compared. It was found that the CCFHT-based TDE has a better accuracy in most cases. Only for very low SNR values (at 0.01) with a relatively few samples (at 5000) the CCF-based TDE is more advantageous.}

ABSTRACT={<p>Fifty years of solar wind observations have provided extensive data that drives an evolving view of the fundamental nature and dynamics of the magnetic, velocity, and density fluctuations that are ubiquitous throughout the heliosphere. Despite the ongoing examination of ever improving data, fundamental questions remain unanswered because there are very few multi-point measurements from a sufficient number of spacecraft in close proximity to fully resolve the three-dimensional dynamics that are at the heart of the problem. Simulations provide new insights and new questions, but most simulations sacrifice one aspect of plasma physics in order to address another. Computers and computational methods remain insufficient to simulate fully compressive, fully nonlinear, collisionless plasma dynamics with sufficient spatial range and dimension to be considered a complete description of solar wind turbulence. For these reasons, there remain multiple divergent opinions as to the underlying dynamics of solar wind turbulence, dissipation, and the observed heating of the thermal plasma. We review observations of solar wind turbulence in so far as they contribute to an understanding of solar wind heating through the existence of energy reservoirs, the dynamics that move energy from the reservoirs to the dissipation scales, and the conversion into heat of energy associated with coherent fluctuations.</p>}}
